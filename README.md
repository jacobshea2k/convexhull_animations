# convexhull_animations
This program utilizes python and matplotlib to animate quickhull, graham scan and gift-wrapping algorithms which all take different steps to find the convex hull of a given set of points. The number of points as well as the range and domain of the points can be changed by the user. Different steps of the algorithms are color coordinated and run in real time.
